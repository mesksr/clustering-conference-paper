Title : Analysis of Pipe Networks

Author : Hassan Abdel Mageid


Abstract : The finite element technique used in the analysis and design of water distribution networks will be presented. The method was applied successfully to the solution of three different networks.

Nodes and pipes are numbered for identification purposes. As a sign convention, any external flow at a joint will be positive when fluid is input and negative when actual consumption occurs.  

 

In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and to show some merits and demerits of the finite element method, a comparison was made on a digital computer with the standard Hardy Cross method. In all cases the finite element method was shown to provide superior performance. Moreover, the programmes were run on three different machines {Wang vs 100, Apple IIe, and IBM microcomputer} to show the effect of increasing storage capacity, machine accuracy, and time saving
