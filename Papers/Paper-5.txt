Title : Water Conservation

Author : Hayder A. Abdel


Abstract : Limited resources and growing needs for water has triggered a nationwide campaign for water conservation in the Sultanate of Oman. 
	
A land and soil survey study of Oman shows the availability of more arable land than present water resources could support. Groundwater is the main source for agricultural production. Over pumping at rates higher than the natural recharge has resulted in lowering of the ground water table, while seawater intrusion lead to an increase in soil salinity. A comprehensive water program is underway to conserve water through efficient irrigation, use of soil additives, modern irrigation systems, agronomic management and institutionalization; and augmentation of resources via introduction of more desalinization plants, more waste water treatment, use of brackish water, water fog collection, and water harvesting by building recharge dam
