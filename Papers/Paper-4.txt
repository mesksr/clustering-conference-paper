Abstract : Wavelet-based statistical signal processing techniques such as denoising and detection typically model the wavelet coefficients as independent or jointly Gaussian. These models are unrealistic for many real-world signals. We develop a new framework for statistical signal processing based on wavelet-domain hidden Markov models (HMMs) that concisely models the statistical dependencies and non-Gaussian statistics encountered in real-world signals. Wavelet-domain HMMs are designed with the intrinsic properties of the wavelet transform in mind and provide powerful, yet tractable, probabilistic signal models. Efficient expectation maximization algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. The new framework is suitable for a wide range of applications, including signal estimation, detection, classification, prediction, and even synthesis. To demonstrate the utility of wavelet-domain HMMs, we develop novel algorithms for signal denoising, classification, and detection.

Invertible wavelet transforms that map integers to integers have important applications in lossless coding. In this paper we present two approaches to build integer to integer wavelet transforms. The first approach is to adapt the precoder of Laroiaet al.,which is used in information transmission; we combine it with expansion factors for the high and low pass band in subband filtering. The second approach builds upon the idea of factoring wavelet transforms into so-called lifting steps. This allows the construction of an integer version of every wavelet transform. Finally, we use these approaches in a lossless image coder and compare the results to those given in the literature.
