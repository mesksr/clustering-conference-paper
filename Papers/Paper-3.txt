Title : Neural networks

Abstract : The term "Neural networks" is a very evocative one. Artificial neural network may be thought as simplified models of the networks of neurons that occurs naturally in the animal brain. From the biological view point the essential requirement is that it should attempt to capture what we believe the essential information processing features of the corresponding "real" network. For enginees this correspondence is not so important and the network offers an alternative form of parallel computing that might be more appropriate for solving the task in hand.

The simplest artificial neuron is the threshold logis unit or TLU .Its basic operation is to perform a weighted sum of its input and then output a "1" if this sum exceeds a threshold,and a "0" otherwise.The TLU is supposed to model the basic "integrate-and-fire" mechanism of real neurons.
	
The building blocks of artificial neural networks are artificial neurons. Neurons are not only enormously complex but also vary considerably in the details of their structure and function. We will therefore describe typical properties enjoyed by a majority of neurons and make the usual working assumption of connectionism that these provide for the bulk of their computational ability.Readers interested in finding out more may consult one of the many texts in neurophysiology; Thompson (1993) provides a good introductory text, while more comprehensive accounts are given by Kandel et al.
